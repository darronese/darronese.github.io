        Hi! Iâ€™m Darron Li, a passionate and dedicated software engineer
        currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at
        Washington State University. My enthusiasm for learning drives me to
        explore and create new technologies and programs. A great example is my
        personal portfolio website, developed using HTML, CSS with TailwindCSS,
        and JavaScript with the React framework. Additionally, I created "Dark
        Ship," an interactive game built with C/C++ using the SFML library for
        graphics. Currently, I am working on "Magic Music," a music theory
        generator developed in Python utilizing the music21 library. Beyond my
        technological pursuits, I am also an accomplished musician with mastery
        of the guitar and piano, which has enhanced my creativity and
        discipline.
