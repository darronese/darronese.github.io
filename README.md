# WIP REVAMPED PORTFOLIO APP

# Idea:

I got inspired by many different portfolio apps that were much better than my original one. That is whyI decided it was time to rebuild the whole project!

# Technologies:
Using Sveltekit, DaisyUI, and GSAP!

# TO-DO:

- Dynamic & Reactive Nav Bar where it is bold depending on the section

- Projects Integration and even embedding into website

- Animated and interactive background
