## Extra 
This is a custom portfolio site made by me! I took a lot of help and inspiration from Neal Wang's website https://github.com/mathletedev/mathletedev.github.io/tree/main and Fireship's YouTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfaSUYaSgRo&t=512s. It was built using React.js, Tailwind.css, and HTML.
